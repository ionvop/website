    About page (who ionvop is):

        I'm currently a 3rd year college student studying Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, and my interests include web development, software development, and game development.

        The programming languages I'm familiar with are VBScript for automations, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP for web development, C# for GUI applications, Java for legacy applications and self-torture, Python for machine-learning, Brainf*ck for fun, Lua for game modding, GLSL for post-processing effects, Turbowarp (Scratch) for game development, and ivpy which is a custom programming language that I made for fun.

        I like to play rhythm games and fast-paced Tetris games. My favorite rhythm games include osu!, mobile games such as Arcaea, Rotaeno, BanG Dream, and arcade rhythm games such as maimai, SDVX, and PIU. My favorite fast-paced Tetris games include TETR.IO and Jstris.

        I'm also learning music production and my favorite genre to listen to is dubstep. My favorite artists include ReeK, Eliminate, and Similar Outskirts. I won't list down the JP artists because there's too many of them. The DAW software I used to use was Caustic 3 but I've since switched to Waveform 11.
